# Python API Challenge: WeatherPy & VacationPy #
# Project Overview #
In this project, I utilized Python along with API requests and JSON data processing to analyze weather patterns and identify ideal vacation destinations. The challenge was divided into two parts: WeatherPy and VacationPy, each leveraging different datasets and APIs.

# WeatherPy #
This section involved analyzing weather data from over 500 cities at varying distances from the equator, using OpenWeatherMap API and Citipy library.

## Accomplishments ##
- Data Collection: Automated the retrieval of weather data for a diverse set of cities using OpenWeatherMap API.
- Weather Analysis: Created a series of scatter plots to explore relationships between latitude and various weather parameters such as temperature, humidity, cloudiness, and wind speed.
- Statistical Modeling: Computed linear regression on the weather data, separately for Northern and Southern Hemispheres, to understand the impact of latitude on weather patterns.
## Insights ##
- Developed a nuanced understanding of how different weather variables vary with latitude.
- Identified and reported on the trends observed through linear regression analyses.
# VacationPy #
In this part, I used the weather data to plan ideal vacation destinations, employing Jupyter Notebooks, geoViews, and the Geoapify API.

## Accomplishments ##
- Interactive Mapping: Visualized the global distribution of cities based on humidity levels using interactive maps.
- Destination Filtering: Applied specific weather criteria (temperature, wind speed, cloudiness) to refine potential vacation destinations.
- Hotel Search: Integrated Geoapify API to locate hotels within a specified radius of each selected city, adding this data to the map.
## Deliverables ##
- Produced an interactive map highlighting cities that meet the ideal vacation criteria, along with nearby hotel information.
- Showcased the ability to translate weather data into practical travel recommendations.
## Technical Skills and Tools ##
- Demonstrated proficiency in Python, specifically in using libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, and Requests.
- Skilled in API interaction and handling JSON data structures.
- Applied data visualization techniques to effectively communicate findings.
## Repository Management ##
- Maintained a well-organized GitHub repository ('python-api-challenge') with appropriate documentation and code segregation.
- Implemented .gitignore to securely manage sensitive API keys and credentials.
